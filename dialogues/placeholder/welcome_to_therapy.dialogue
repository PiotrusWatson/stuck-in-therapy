Freud: welcome to therapy!
Freud: this is a lil bit experimental.... a lil bit edgy.... but hopefully we can all grow and change by the end
You: *edgy....edge....why is that making me think of something*
You: *god I remember edging.......what a freak i was.....i'm such a lil freak.....*
Freud: anyway, let's start with your child hood
You: *my hooded penis....as a child.....edging......im not normal....*
Freud: tell me about your child hood. was it cool? fun? or was it super lame?
